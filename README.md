## COVID-19 Outbreak Comparison: Vaccines and Affected Countries
Project Overview:

This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and investigates the effectiveness of various vaccines. We aim to identify factors influencing hospitalization rates, deaths, and overall disease burden.

**Source of Information:**

Viral Pandemics in the Past Two Decades: An Overview (Source: https://journals.lww.com/jfmpc/fulltext/2021/10080/viral_pandemics_in_the_past_two_decades__an.5.aspx)
Research Focus:

Comparative Analysis: We compare select countries with similar and contrasting wealth levels to understand the impact of socioeconomic factors.
Vaccine Effectiveness: We explore potential differences in the effectiveness of various vaccines (focusing on Pfizer and Moderna) based on available data.
Age Group Analysis: We examine how vaccination rates and outcomes vary across different age groups.
Data Sources:

Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
OWID COVID-19 Data Repository: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data Â  
Methodology:

Data Acquisition and Cleaning: We retrieve data from the listed sources and perform data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Analysis and Visualization: We use Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Dash to analyze and visualize the data. Different visualizations like boxplots, scatterplots, violin plots, bar charts, Treemaps, chord maps, and Cartopy maps will be employed to explore relationships between variables.
Field Study Approach: We compare data from selected countries to identify patterns and trends.
**Software Stack:**

Jupyter Notebook
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Dash)
Anaconda
Limitations:

**Data quality and availability may differ across countries.**
Attributing specific outcomes solely to vaccination is challenging due to various influencing factors.
Expected Outcome:

We aim to gain insights into how national wealth, vaccine types, and age demographics influence COVID-19 outcomes.
The visualizations will provide a clear picture of these relationships.
Further Work:

Depending on data availability, we may investigate the effectiveness of additional vaccines.
Disclaimer:

Excess mortality data interpretations may vary based on expert opinions. However, the project aims to present valuable insights despite these nuances.
