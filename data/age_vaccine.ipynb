    "This Python code addresses a situation where a CSV file has a date column containing only \"day\" values (possibly for test data) and a vaccinated indicator. The code performs two key actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Year Extraction: It extracts the year from the date column. Since the column holds just \"day\" values, conversion to full dates might not be necessary. However, for future compatibility or handling unexpected formats, the code attempts date conversion (with error handling) and extracts the year if successful. Missing values (NaN) are gracefully handled by replacing them with a placeholder value (e.g., -1).\n",
    "Grouping by Year: It groups the data in the DataFrame by the extracted year. This allows you to analyze trends or patterns within each year based on the other columns in the CSV file.\n",
